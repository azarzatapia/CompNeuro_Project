\section*{Abstract}

This project explores computational models in neuroscience, focusing on the simulation and analysis of neural systems. We implement and evaluate various models to understand neural dynamics, information processing, and learning mechanisms. The results provide insights into the computational principles underlying brain function and highlight the potential of computational approaches in neuroscience research.
